# OpenAIVoiceChat

This project uses GPT-3 to respond to voice messages sent by users in Telegram, converting the audio to text before sending it to the model for processing. The model's response is then sent back to the Telegram chat with the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 12 or higher
- npm 6 or higher
- A Telegram bot and bot token
- A Google Cloud Platform account and project with the Google Speech-to-Text and Google Cloud Storage APIs enabled
- A OpenAI API Key
- ffmpeg

### Installing

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Morzat95/OpenAIVoiceChat.git
```

2. Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```

## Deploying to AWS

To deploy this project to AWS, follow these steps:

1. Connect to your instance using SSH. You can find the IP address of your instance in the AWS console.

```
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-instance-ip
```

2. Navigate to the directory where your app is located.

```
cd /path/to/app
```

3. Pull the latest updates from your repository.

```
git pull origin main
```

4. Build the Docker image.

```
docker build -t openaivoicechat .
```

5. Run the Docker container (note that I'm using the Google Speech to Text Service but with a little bit of code you can change it to use other Speech to Text Service).

```
docker run -d -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path_to_credentials_file -e apiKeyFile=your_speech_to_text_api_token -e defaultLanguage=en-US -e TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_telegram_api_token -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_token -p 3000:3000 openaivoicechat
```

Your app should now be up and running on your AWS instance. You can access it by visiting your instance's IP address in your web browser.
